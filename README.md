Having over a decade of programming experience and wide arrays of skillsets under my belt, from architecting distributed systems to powered machine learning applications, I have in-depth knowledge of C++ and Python to design, architect and implement sophisticated and state-of-the-art software solutions. This is perfectly driven by my excellent problem-solving skill and detail-oriented approach when I both analyse and develop.
